      <h2>About the Project:</h2>
      <p>
        The project "Interactive-map-web-app" is a capstone project
        developed by Team Ahmed for the Spring Semester 2024 (SS24). This web
        application showcases an interactive map, crafted using Leafletâ€”a
        leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive
        maps. The data powering the map is sourced from
        OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project that creates a free, editable map
        of the world.The primary focus of this project is to provide an engaging
        and informative user experience through the interactive map. The map is
        designed to present content related to Jason Washington commemoration,
        offering users detailed insights and visual representations of
        significant locations and events associated with the commemoration.The
        project's repository is a collection of the essential
        files that constitute the application's frontend. It includes HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript. For those interested in exploring the project's
        technical details or contributing to its development, all the resources
        and documentation are available on the project's
        <a href="https://github.com/Ahmadsafa21/Interactive-map-web-app">GitHub repository</a>.
